## Project Overview

This larger aim of this project was to examine how rainfall intensity, elevation, and drainage infrastructure influence urban flood risk using open-source global datasets. By conducting exploratory analysis, regression modeling, and clustering, the goal was to derive data-driven insights to support flood-resilient infrastructure planning and climate adaptation strategies.

## Objectives

The project sought to address several key analytical questions:
🌧 Rainfall Patterns: Where are rainfall intensities highest across global urban areas?

🏔 Elevation Influence: How does elevation relate to rainfall intensity and flood exposure?

🚰 Drainage Systems: How do storm drain proximity and drainage density vary by land use?

📊 Flood Risk Zoning: What distinct flood-risk zones can be identified using clustering?

🧠 Resilience Insights: What infrastructure or planning actions can mitigate high-risk conditions?


## Data

Global Urban Flood Risk Dataset (CareerFoundry-provided for project purposes)

Rainfall Intensity per Urban Segment

Elevation and Drainage Infrastructure Metrics

Land Use and Storm Drain Type Classifications

## Tools & Libraries

- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

## Methodology

- Data Wrangling: Cleaned missing values, removed duplicates, standardized data types.
- Exploratory Analysis (EDA): Analyzed rainfall patterns, elevation, and drainage characteristics.
- Linear Regression: Modeled relationship between rainfall intensity and elevation.
- K-Means Clustering: Identified distinct flood-risk clusters based on key hydrologic variables.
- Visualization: Designed Tableau dashboards to communicate results and recommendations.

## Key Insights

- Flood-Prone Areas: Low-elevation zones with high rainfall intensity and limited drain access face the greatest flood risk.
- Infrastructure Imbalance: Drainage density varies sharply across land-use types, with industrial and commercial areas having the highest coverage.
- Elevation Impact: Higher elevation areas experience lower rainfall intensity and reduced flood vulnerability.
- Cluster Results: Four distinct flood-risk zones were identified, ranging from high-risk lowlands to low-risk uplands.

## Recommendations

- Invest in Drainage Infrastructure: Expand storm drain coverage in low-lying, high-rainfall clusters.
- Adopt Nature-Based Solutions: Use green infrastructure (e.g., rain gardens, bioswales) to absorb runoff.
- Preserve High-Elevation Green Zones: Maintain upland areas as natural resilience buffers.
- Integrate Data-Driven Planning: Use cluster insights to prioritize high-risk zones in urban resilience budgets.

## Final Takeaway
Flood vulnerability is not defined by rainfall alone—it emerges from the interaction of topography, drainage infrastructure, and land use. By combining data analytics with spatial visualization, this project demonstrates how cities can target investments in stormwater systems and strengthen resilience to climate-driven flood risks.
